### Atomic Design Approach

There are various ways to structure a project, and for this one, we’ve chosen to embrace the **Atomic Design** methodology. This approach, combined with leveraging third-party libraries such as Material UI, Tailwind, and others, allows us to build a scalable and consistent UI.

Whenever possible, our goal is to avoid building custom components and styles from scratch if existing libraries and tools can be effectively leveraged. This approach not only speeds up development but also ensures we’re using well-tested and widely-adopted solutions.

If you're looking to deepen your understanding of how Atomic Design can be implemented with React, this resource is a great starting point: [Example of React with Atomic Design Methodology](https://medium.com/@simo-dlamini/a-friendly-guide-to-the-atomic-file-structure-in-react-8bd33e55361c#:~:text=The%20Atomic%20Design%20methodology%20provides%20a%20way%20to,elements%20that%20make%20our%20apps%20consistent%20and%20scalable).

### Purpose and Structure

This approach focuses on organizing reusable components in a clear, maintainable way, ensuring that any developer—whether new to the project or stepping in after another has left—can easily navigate and contribute to the codebase. While this methodology enhances consistency across the team, it’s important to note that it is not a Design System in itself, but rather a method for structuring React components efficiently.

### Example of a Folder Structure

```plaintext
src/
└── components/
    ├── atoms/
    │   ├── buttons/
    │   ├── typography/
    │   ├── data-display/
    │   └── forms/
    ├── molecules/
    │   ├── forms/
    │   ├── cards/
    │   ├── navigation/
    │   └── overlays/
    ├── organisms/
    │   ├── headers/
    │   ├── footers/
    │   ├── layouts/
    │   └── profiles/
    └── templates/
```

### Organization Rationale

The project is organized into four main categories, following the Atomic Design methodology:

1. **Atoms**: The basic building blocks of the UI, such as buttons, typography elements, and form inputs. These are the simplest and smallest components in the system.

2. **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms that form more complex components, like form fields or card layouts. These components are functional and reusable across the application.

3. **Organisms**: Larger, more complex components composed of molecules and atoms. These components make up significant sections of the UI, such as headers, footers, and layout structures.

4. **Templates**: High-level components that define the overall structure or layout of a page or section of the application. Templates ensure consistency in layout across different parts of the application by combining organisms, molecules, and atoms.

### View-Only Components

These components should be treated as views that are reusable for displaying data. They should not be tied to any API calls or hardcoded functions. While it’s perfectly fine to pass values into these components as props, their primary role is to present the data that is passed to them, ensuring a clear separation between logic and presentation.

### Flexibility

This structure is intended to be scalable and adaptable, supporting the ongoing growth and evolution of the project. As new features are added or old ones are deprecated, this structure is open to change, allowing for adjustments that better meet the needs of the development process.
