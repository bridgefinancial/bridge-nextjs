## Component Preview and Design with Storybook

Storybook allows you to design, test, and style components independently, which speeds up UI development by removing the need to integrate navigation or application logic. You can focus on component functionality, responsive design, and props handling before integrating components into the main application. This approach prevents entangling components with data or other logic prematurely.

For an in-depth understanding of separating the view from data, refer to the **[Atomic Design Patterns documentation](src/components/design-system/DESIGN_SYSTEM_README.md)**. This guide explains how to structure components in a way that enhances reusability and clarity.

### Why Prioritize View-First Coding?

Designing the view layer first reduces the likelihood of production bugs and provides clear documentation for each component's usage. This approach also prevents duplicate efforts as the team grows by establishing a single source of truth for component implementations.

## Project Setup Documentation

Before diving into the code, please review the setup documentation. Understanding the project structure, design patterns, and coding conventions will make it easier to navigate and contribute to the codebase:

## Project Folder Structure

The following example outlines the project’s folder structure, with directories for different aspects of the application, including assets, components, and utility functions.

```
- public
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── icons/
  │   └── images/
- src
  ├── app
  │   ├── auth/
  │   └── portal/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── design-system/
  │   │   ├── atoms/
  │   │   ├── molecules/
  │   │   ├── organisms/
  │   │   └── templates/
  │   ├── routing/
  │   └── seo/
  ├── hoc/

## Routing with Next.js App Router

Our project leverages the Next.js App Router, which provides a flexible, declarative routing approach. Here are some important concepts to understand:

### Shared Routes and Layouts

The App Router supports shared layouts that wrap nested pages, enabling consistent UI structures across multiple routes. For example, a persistent header or sidebar component can be defined once and applied across pages automatically.

### Dynamic Routing with Segments

Dynamic routing is achieved through segment-based syntax. For example, directories with `[param]` in their names indicate dynamic segments that adapt based on URL parameters. This flexibility makes it easy to build routes that handle various parameters and dynamic content.

## Reusable Styles and Components in the Design System

### Design System Components

Reusable styles and components are organized within the `design-system` directory under `components`. These are generic, reusable building blocks such as buttons, typography, and layout templates, designed for consistency across the application.

- **Usage:** Import these components into the `app` directory and customize them for specific pages or features as needed. This approach ensures a consistent look and feel while maintaining flexibility in design.

### Component Placement

- **Reusable Header/Footer Components:** Place complex and reusable components, such as headers or footers, in `components/design-system/organisms`. Organisms are composed of multiple atoms and molecules, forming meaningful UI sections.
- **Layout Components:** Layout components that define page structure (headers, sidebars, and content areas) should be placed in `components/design-system/templates`. Templates provide high-level structures that arrange organisms for consistent page layouts.

## Data Fetching in the App Router

Explore the data-fetching capabilities in the App Router, including fetching data at the layout level. This approach can enhance performance and simplify data management by leveraging React Server Components.

---

## Redirects

The `Middleware.ts` file handles authentication checks and redirects users based on login status. This file is designed for flexibility, with the potential for future enhancements as the app grows.

---

## Getting Started

To start the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

You can edit the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. Changes will be reflected live.
